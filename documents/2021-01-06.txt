-------------------------
Today I have performed branching,merging and many more git commands.
Also conpleted how to switch branch and push on to remote etc.
-----------------
1)Git Alias
-->git config --global alias.st status
:if we want to check status then only type [git st] insted of git status
2)Git branching and merging
Types of branch
1)Long running branches
2)Topic branches
-->git branch
:giving branch
-->git checkout -b [branchname]
:create branch and switch
-->git checkout [branchname]
:switch branch
-->git merge [branchname]
:Merging in main branch
-->git branch -d [branchname]
:delete breach if commited else warning message showing
-->git branch -m [old name] [new name]
:rename branch
Then solving problem on merge conflict.
3)Git log
-->git log
:show all commit
-->git log --pretty=oneline
:show all commit in one line
4)Git Revert 
-->git revert [commit id]
:reverting to givan id
5)Git Stash
to store temporary changes in memory
-->git stash
-->git stash list
:give list with stash id
-->git stash apply
:we can re-apply the changes that we just stashed by using the git stash command.
-->git stash drop [id]
:drop stash
-->git stash push -m "message"
:push stash
