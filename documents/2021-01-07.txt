-->git reset --mixed
:In this command commit will removed and all files moved on unstaging area.
2)Git Cherry-Pick

:It is used to access the changes introduced to a sub-branch, without changing the branch.
3)Git Log Stat
-->This command will display the files that have been modified
4)Git log Patch
-->git log --patch 
:The git log patch command displays the files that have been modified in directory.
5)For checking author
-->git log --author=["Author name"] 
:The above command will display all the commits made by the given author.
6)Git show
-->git show --name-only [commit id]
:It will shows all details of commited file and deleted files etc.
