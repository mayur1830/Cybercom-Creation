Topic:Git & GitHub
--------------------------
I had just basic idea about the git and github.
I have practice document that provided by you.
Now today i learned many things of git.
I learned  basic command of git then how to create repository and how to do commit etc..
Then many more about git three stage architecture[working directory,staging area,git directory(repository)] and how to cloning repository in local machine and git file structure life cycle[untracked,unmodified,modified,staged]
-------------------------
1)Basic command of git
-->git status
-->git init
-->git add . or git add --a
-->git commit -m "Message" or git commit(Then editor open we have to press key esc+:+wq)
-->git log (see all commit of git) 
2)If we want to delete .git then
-->open git bash 
-->rm-rf .git
-->means now it is untracking stage
3)git clone [url]
-->it is used for clonning git repositories.
4)If we want to ignore files in out project then
-->open git bash
-->run command
-->touch .gitignore
-->in this file we have to put file or folder directory that we want to be a ignore.
-->like we want to ignore all log file then in .gitignore write(*.log)
5)git diff (It differencing to working area to staging area)
6)git diff --staged (It differencing staging area to previous commit)
7)If we want to skip staging area
-->git commit -a -m "Message"
8)remove and rename
-->for remove(git rm (file name))[It will remove the file]
-->for rename(git mv (original name)(new name))
9)How to untrack file
-->git rm --cached (file name)
10)Git remote 
-->git remote
-->git remote -v
-->how to add ssh etc
Now performing branching and merging in git.
